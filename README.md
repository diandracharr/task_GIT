# QA Engineer Bootcamp – Digital Skola
This repository highlights my learning progress from Sessions 2, 3, and 4 of the QA Engineer Bootcamp at Digital Skola.
## Overview
Each session focuses on a different aspect of software testing — from documenting test plans, test case, and bug reports to writing simple JavaScript scripts — blending hands-on practice with core QA fundamentals.
## Contents
Task 2: Test documentation — including Test Plan, Test Case, and Bug Report for the SauceDemo website.

Task 3: Practiced JavaScript Fundamentals by generating a right-triangle pattern using a for loop.

Task 4: Explored JavaScript Advanced concepts by building a simple calculator function for basic arithmetic operations.
